            <br>
            <p>Rather helpfully, it turns out that the state of Connecticut publishes data on the participation and 
            performance of the students at each of its high schools on the SAT. Using the 
            <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sat-school-participation-and-performance-2012-2013">SAT School
            Participation and Performance</a> dataset in concert with Google Fusion Tables, we were able to map each
            Connecticut high school and color-code them by the proportion of students who scored a 1550 (out of 2400) 
            or above, which the state considers to be an indicator of college and career readiness.</p>
            <br>
            <iframe width="700" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col2+from+13l_FQPCHHXU-khaVIkPhi1BUPodEaYx-Gc6PFQyq&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=41.58964636003264&amp;lng=-72.42470811239048&amp;t=1&amp;z=8&amp;l=col2&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=3&amp;hml=GEOCODABLE"></iframe>
            <br></br>
            <p>We then obtained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Connecticut_locations_by_per_capita_income">
            income statistics</a> for (almost) each county subdivision in Connecticut by scraping 
            Wikipedia. By combining this dataset with <a href="http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/connecticut_data.html">
            geographical boundary data</a> from the University of Connecticut, we were able to again use Google Fusion
            Tables to color-code the county subdivisions of Connecticut by their median family income.</p>
            <br></br>
            <iframe width="700" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col2%3E%3E1+from+169N4F09N_fjXsNsaCpX1fv1B-N9v4vZHROUxNkbK&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=41.635909487333095&amp;lng=-72.38579191416727&amp;t=1&amp;z=8&amp;l=col2%3E%3E1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=KML"></iframe>
          	<br></br>
          	We created an overlay of the two (as a static image, because our knowledge of how to use Google Fusion Tables
          	only goes so far).
          	<br></br>
          	<img width="700" src="overlay.png" alt="Italian Trulli">
          	<br></br>
          	<p>From this overlay, we're able to observe that at least to the human eye, the pockets of poorest performance on
          	the SAT do seem to cluster within the county subdivisions in the lowest socioeconomic bracket; likewise, the
          	schools with the highest performance on the SAT are all located within the two wealthiest county subdivisions,
          	which report median family incomes in excess of $200,000 a year.</p>
          	<p>Although the trend is easiest to observe in the poorest and richest populations, the relationship between
          	socioeconomic status and SAT score is noticeable in the middle groups as well. A couple of interesting observations:
          	only three schools where more than 60% of students scored 1550 or above were located in county subdivisions with median family
          	incomes under $100,000 a year; and not a single school in a county subdivision with a median family income over
          	$100,000 a year had fewer than 40% of its students score 1550 or above.</p>
